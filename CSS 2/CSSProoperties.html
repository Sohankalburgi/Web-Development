    <h1>Afghan Hound</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The Afghan Hound is a hound distinguished by its thick, fine, silky coat, and a tail with a ring curl at the end. The breed is selectively bred for its unique features in the cold mountains of <a href="https:www.google.com/search?q=Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>

Other types or breeds of similar appearance are the Taigan from the mountainous Tian Shan region on the Chinese border of Afghanistan, and the Barakzay, or Kurram Valley Hound.
